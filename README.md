# TaskManagerWithVisualBasic
Task Manager with login functionality. It was created from scratch using ASP.NET Core MVC 2 Template.

I have implemented a TaskModule here To adopt CRUD Operations.
Implemented User Registration and Stored hashed password for verifying.
To Use this Application:
Create a database name "aspnetdb" || Change the connectionString and DatabaseName accordingly
Create Two Tables with Following Properties
task(id, name, status, userid)
register(id, fullname, username, password, email)
